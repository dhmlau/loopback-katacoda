To generate your application using the toolkit, run the `lb4 app` command and follow the prompt. You can also skip the prompt by using the `--yes` option and providing the application name. That is:

`lb4 app todo --yes`{{execute}}

Now that the application is created, go to the application folder:
`cd todo`{{execute}}
